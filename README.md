DigitalMediaSocialNetworks Coursework 1

The aim of this task is to make use of publically available web APIs to gather social media data. In this instance, you will set up authorisation to Twitterâ€™s REST APIs, and query timeline, profile, followers, and friends of a populated Twitter account through it. The response data is JSON-formatted, and can as such easily be used for later analysis.
